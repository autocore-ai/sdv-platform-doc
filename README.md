The SDV software stack is based on open source Autoware/ROS2/DDS and Zenoh, where DDS/Zenoh form an E2E Vehicle-Edge-Cloud middleware layer for the SDV platform. Thru the integration with Futureweiâ€™s open source KubeEdge project, the SDV platform will leverage Cloud Native Ecosystem tools to provide management, monitoring and software LCM (Life-Cycle-Management) functions.
